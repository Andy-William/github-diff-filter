# github-diff-filter

A bookmarklet to allow you to filter the list of files in GitHub's comparison views.

When viewing a commit or pull request with a large number of modified files or lines,
it might be helpful to have the ability to filter that list of files on the fly so that you can:
- review smaller chunks of it at one time
- ignore things that need no review or can't practically be reviewed (e.g., minified files)


## Getting Started

1. Open up [`dist/github-diff-filter.min.js`](https://github.com/Scotchester/github-diff-filter/blob/master/dist/github-diff-filter.min.js).
2. Copy the entirety of its contents.
3. Create a new bookmark in your browser and paste what you copied (and _only_
   what you copied) into the URL field.
4. Visit a GitHub comparison page (e.g., the **Files Changed** tab on a Pull Request)
   and click the bookmarklet you just created.
5. Enter a query into the field and press `Return` or click the **Hide** button.
6. Behold the magical disappearing files!


## Release History

### v1.0.0 â€“ April 1, 2014

First release! Allows for simple hiding of files matching your query. Tested on
Google Chrome 31+.


## Roadmap

Some general, not-set-in-stone ideas for feature buildout order.

### v1.0.1

- Add unit tests.
- Test in more browsers.

### v1.1

- Add button to unhide all previously-hidden files.
- Add ability to enter multiple comma-separated arguments into the text field.

### v1.2

- Add to a list of activated filters each time the form is submitted.
- Allow for selective deactivation of single filters.

### v1.3

- Add a second form: **Show only files matching this query**
  (e.g., show me only `.css` files)

_Some UX work needed to figure out how best to handle this.
Would it override hiding filters already set?
Is it actually a second bookmarklet?_

### v1.4

- Detect filetypes present and offer checkboxes to show/hide them.

### v1.5

- Insert checkboxes next to each file in the Diff Stats list for one-click hiding of that file.
- Make the file diffs themselves collapsible on demand.
